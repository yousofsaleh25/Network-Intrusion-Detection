# Network-Intrusion-Detection

## Introduction
In this work, we explore different datasets for Network Intrusion Detection. The objective is to classify attack signals from normal ones, considering the increasing challenge of computer security and intrusion detection in today's networked environments. The next Figure illustrate our framework.

## Feature Selection Techniques
To build effective models, we utilized various feature selection techniques, namely:

- Information gain
- Gain ratio
- Chi2
- Relief
